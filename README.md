# RM-YTID

This is a simple bash script that removes the last 14 characters of a filename before the file extension. I made this to remove the video ID that are found on files downloaded with yt-dlp.
## Usage:
You can run this script in a directory and it'll go through all the files in the directory, or you can give it a filepath.
